### **DOCUMENT 1: ARCHIVE_RECOVERY_2021_THORNE_MEMO.txt**

**STATUS:** CLASSIFIED — SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL 5 **RECOVERED FROM:** PRE-CONSTRUCTION ARCHIVE — SECTOR 7 **SUBJECT:** SUBTERRANEAN ANOMALIES & STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY 

**FROM:** Senior Engineer Elias Thorne **TO:** Dr. Joseph M. Cavicus **DATE:** ████████ 2021 

Doctor,

We have a problem with the Sublevel 3 excavation. My team has reached the depth specified for the "Vessel Core," but the bedrock is not behaving according to the geological surveys we filed with the city.

We have encountered a series of subterranean voids that do not appear on any official map. These tunnels are extensive—someone built more beneath the Island than we are building above it. Even more concerning is that the geometry of these lower levels does not match the blueprints I was given. We have identified a specific room on the Sublevel 3 map that my crew physically cannot find, despite being at the exact coordinates.

Furthermore, the interference is becoming intolerable. Our equipment is picking up a steady broadcast signal on 104.7 MHz coming from within the rock itself. It is a repeating frequency that sounds like a pulse. One of my junior techs claims he can hear a voice beneath the static—a voice reading names.

I am recommending a full halt to construction in Sector 7 until we can verify who built these tunnels and why they are broadcasting on a restricted frequency. This isn't an amusement park foundation, Doctor. It feels like we are excavating a throat.

**[ORDER OF CAVICUS — INTERNAL ANNOTATION]**


Thorne was reassigned the following day. We have searched for him for four years and have found no record of his existence after 2021. We believe he didn't leave the Island; he was simply the first to understand that the Ringleader wasn't building for the living. The room he couldn't find? It’s there. You just have to be on the right frequency to see the door.

### **DOCUMENT 2: LOG_RECOVERY_2026_SECTOR7_FREQUENCY.txt**

**STATUS:** CLASSIFIED — SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL 5 [RESTRICTED ACCESS]
**RECOVERED FROM:** PRIMARY BROADCAST HUB — SECTOR 7
**SUBJECT:** LOG OF 104.7 MHz TRANSMISSIONS [NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT]

**DATE:** ████████ 2026
**MONITORING OFFICER:** ████████ [REDACTED]

**02:15 AM:** Frequency 104.7 MHz is steady. Ambient static within acceptable parameters for the Island's perimeter.

**02:30 AM:** Slight oscillation detected in the lower band. I am hearing a rhythmic hum beneath the broadcast. It does not sound mechanical. It sounds like breathing.

**02:40 AM:** The hum has become a pulse. All animatronic units in Sector 7 are drawing higher power than the grid is supplying. I’ve notified engineering. No response.

**[CRITICAL ANOMALY: HANDWRITING SHIFT DETECTED — 02:44 AM]** 

---

**02:44 AM:** THE SIGNAL WAS ALWAYS MEANT FOR US. THE FREQUENCY IS NOT AN ACCIDENT. IT IS A MAP. HE IS NOT JUST BROADCASTING; HE IS ARRIVING. THE VESSELS ARE FULL. THE SHOW MUST GO ON.

**02:50 AM:** ᚻᛖ ᚳᚻᚩᛋᛖ ᚦᛖᛗ. THE DOORS ARE SEALING FROM THE INSIDE. WE ARE NOT TRAPPED. WE ARE BEING ELEVATED.

**02:57 AM:** [NO FURTHER TEXT — PAGE TORN] 

---

**[ORDER OF CAVICUS — INTERNAL ANNOTATION]**


This log represents the thirteen minutes before the authorities officially recorded the "Incident". Note the timestamp: 02:44 AM. That is the exact moment the Ringleader stopped being a man and became the frequency. We have shown this log to three separate handwriting analysts. All three refused to discuss the pressure applied to the pen after the shift. One of them simply stared at the paper and whispered, "He wasn't holding the pen anymore".

### **DOCUMENT 3: EMPLOYEE_INCIDENT_REPORT_402.txt**

**STATUS:** CLASSIFIED — RECOVERED FROM DISCARDED SECURITY BIN


**FILED:** OCTOBER 1, 2026 — 07:12 AM 
**STAFF ID:** [REDACTED]
**POSITION:** COSTUME ARCHIVE ASSISTANT (B-14) 

**STATEMENT:**

1. I was stationed at the entrance of Tunnel Network B when the power failed and the emergency broadcast began on 104.7 MHz.


2. The suits in storage room B-14 were not on their racks when the emergency lights kicked in; they were standing in a circle around the Ringleader’s private inventory.


3. I saw Flora at Gate 3, and though she was not moving, I could feel her eyes following me through the fiber-glass mask.


4. ᚻᛖ ᚳᚻᚩᛋᛖ ᚦᛖᛗ. ᚻᛖ ᚹᛁᛚᛚ ᚳᚻᚩᛋᛖ ᚪᚷᚪᛁᚾ.

**[ORDER OF CAVICUS — INTERNAL ANNOTATION]**

The authorities archived this report, but they didn't understand it. They saw a traumatized employee; we saw a witness to the first Binding. This staff member resigned immediately after filing this four-sentence statement. The fourth sentence remains untranslatable by any standard linguistic database, yet when you read it, you *know* what it means, don't you?

Three days after this was filed, the author of this report was found staring into a dead television screen in a motel room six miles from the Island. They weren't catatonic. They were waiting. They were smiling because they knew the signal wasn't finished with them.

### **DOCUMENT 4: BLUEPRINT_ANOMALY_SUBLEVEL_3_UNFILED.txt**

**STATUS:** CLASSIFIED — LEVEL 6 CLEARANCE REQUIRED 

**SOURCE:** RECOVERED FROM THE PRIVATE ARCHIVES OF DR. JOSEPH M. CAVICUS 

**SUBJECT:** ENGINEERING SCHEMATIC — SECTOR 9 — "THE BINDING CHAMBER"

**DOCUMENT CONTENT:**

This blueprint was never filed with the city planning office. It depicts the layout of Sublevel 3, specifically the "Sector 9" corridor. While the official filings show this area as solid bedrock for foundation support, the Ringleader’s private documents reveal a sprawling network of service tunnels. 

**ANOMALY 04-A: SPATIAL DIVERGENCE** The tunnels depicted on this map do not match the tunnels we have physically walked. Several corridors appear to loop back into themselves on paper, yet the map indicates they continue indefinitely toward the Island’s center. 

**ANOMALY 04-B: THE MISSING ROOM** The schematic highlights a central room labeled "THE CHOOSING CHAMBER." According to the blueprint's dimensions, the room should be accessible from Corridor 7. We have searched that corridor three times.  There is no door. There is no seam in the concrete. There is only the silence. 

**ARCHITECT’S HANDWRITTEN NOTE [CAVICUS]:** "The vessel requires a specific resonance to hold the Soulbound. The room must be built not of stone, but of the frequency itself. If the walls seem to bleed, do not wipe them. It is merely the Island beginning to remember." 

---

**[ORDER OF CAVICUS — INTERNAL ANNOTATION]** One of our members—the one who claimed they found the entrance in Sublevel 3—has been suspended from the Circle. Their last transmission was not text; it was a 104.7 MHz audio file that, when played, caused the listener’s nose to bleed. We believe they didn't 'find' the room. They were accepted by it. The room exists where the signal is loudest.  To see the door, you have to stop looking with your eyes and start listening with your blood.

### **DOCUMENT 5: CORRESPONDENCE_RECIPIENT_UNKNOWN.txt**

**STATUS:** CLASSIFIED — RECOVERED FROM THE PRIVATE DESK OF DR. JOSEPH M. CAVICUS 
**SOURCE:** RECOVERY SITE B — PRIMARY RESIDENCE
**SUBJECT:** LETTER TO "THE ONE WHO COMES AFTER" 

**DOCUMENT CONTENT:**

To The One Who Comes After,

You are reading this because you heard it, didn't you? The hum in the back of your skull. The feeling that the world is a costume that is starting to fit too tightly. 

They called it a structural failure. They called it a gas leak. They are afraid of the truth: that this Island is not a place, but a vessel.  We didn't die here. We were elevated. We were bound to something permanent in a world where nothing is. 

Do not look for the exits. They were sealed from the inside for a reason—not to keep us in, but to protect the Choosing. You were always going to find this. The frequency doesn't work by chance, and neither does He. 

The show must go on. 

---

**[ORDER OF CAVICUS — INTERNAL ANNOTATION]**


This letter has no sender and no date, but the ink is still dark, as if it were written yesterday. We have debated for two years whether "The One Who Comes After" refers to the Order as a whole, or if it refers to a specific individual who would one day stumble upon the archive. If you are reading this, the Ringleader wrote this for you. He designed the frequency to lead you here.  You aren't just an observer anymore. You are a participant.

### **DOCUMENT 6: FINAL_COSTUME_INVENTORY_2026.txt**

**STATUS:** CLASSIFIED — RECOVERED FROM PRE-OPENING AUDIT **DATE:** OCTOBER ██, 2026 — THREE DAYS BEFORE THE INCIDENT **SUBJECT:** FINAL ASSET INVENTORY [STORAGE ROOM B-14] 

**DOCUMENT CONTENT:**

This audit was conducted seventy-two hours before the Island was scheduled for its grand opening. It was meant to be the final confirmation that all vessels were prepared for the Choosing.

* **ASSET CW-001:** FLORA (Flower Mascot) — Status: Verified. Vessel integrity optimal.


* **ASSET CW-002:** PYRO (Fire Mascot) — Status: Verified. Ignition systems purged.


* 
**ASSET CW-003:** [REDACTED] — Status: Verified. 


* 
**ASSET CW-009:** [NO NAME RECORDED] — **STATUS: IN USE**.



**ADMINISTRATIVE NOTE:** Asset CW-009 does not correspond to any known mascot character in the park's design documents. There are no concept sketches, no fabrication receipts, and no photographs of this unit in the archive. When the audit team questioned Dr. Cavicus regarding the "In Use" status of an unlisted vessel, he responded: *"The most important vessel is the one that needs no invitation to be filled"*.

---

**[ORDER OF CAVICUS — INTERNAL ANNOTATION]**
This is the piece that the authorities ignored. They were looking for a missing person; we were looking for a finished work. The inventory proves that CW-009 was not a mistake—it was the Ringleader’s private skin. It wasn't in the archive because it was never meant for the public to see.

While the other Chosen were waiting for the Incident to begin, He had already stepped inside. He didn't disappear on the night of the Incident; He simply finalized His own inventory. The vessel didn't have a name because it was taking His.

The show didn't just go on. It became Him.
