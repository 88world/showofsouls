Subheadline:
THE SIGNAL WAS ALWAYS MEANT FOR YOU.

Body — erratic, urgent, genuinely unsettling:
You didn't stumble onto this.

Frequency doesn't work that way.
Neither does He.

In 2026, something happened at Flora's Wonderland that the
authorities sealed, redacted, and buried.
They called it a structural failure.
They called it a gas leak.
They called it a lot of things.

We were there.
                    We are still there.

The Ringleader — Dr. Joseph M. Cavicus — did not build an
amusement park.
He built a vessel.
And on the night of the Incident,
the vessels were filled.

They walk the island.
They do not age.
They do not leave.
They were chosen, and now they are eternal.

Five years later, the island is still sealed.
The signal is still broadcasting.
And you —
you just found it.

Welcome to the Order of Cavicus.
We've been waiting for someone like you.

FINAL TRANSMISSION

Emergency broadcast UI:
● EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM
► SIGNAL SOURCE: UNKNOWN
► ORIGIN: FLORA'S WONDERLAND — ACTIVE
► FREQUENCY: 104.7 MHz

Main recruiting message — direct, urgent, personal:
THEY WERE CHOSEN.
SO WERE YOU.

Body:
The Order of Cavicus has existed in the margins since 2026.
We don't have a building. We don't have a congregation.
We have the signal, and we have each other.

If what you've seen on this site made something inside you
recognize something —
that feeling is not random.

He designed the frequency that way.

The island is still sealed. A new chapter begins in 2031.
Until then — we watch. We wait. We gather.

You found this for a reason.
Don't ignore it.

DATE: ████████ 2026
LOCATION: FLORA'S WONDERLAND — SECTOR 7
CASUALTIES: ████████████
STATUS: ONGOING CONTAINMENT

Body — cult commentary woven into government-style formatting:
► At approximately 02:47 AM, multiple animatronic units
  deviated from standard behavior protocols.

  [They didn't deviate. They arrived.]

► Security personnel reported ██████████████████
  in the underground service tunnels.

  [We believe this was the first witness to a Choosing.
   We have tried to find them. We cannot.]

► Costume storage room B-14 was found ████████
  with evidence of ████████████████████

  [B-14 is where the vessels are stored.
   He knew exactly what He was doing when He built it there.]

► SUBJECT "FLORA" — last seen at Gate 3.
  All exit routes were sealed from the INSIDE.

  [She sealed them.
   Not to trap anyone.
   To protect what was happening inside.]

► NOTE: Investigators reported hearing a broadcast signal
  on frequency 4625 KHz repeating throughout the night:

        "THE SHOW MUST GO ON"

  [It is still repeating.
   Right now.
   As you read this.]

Title: CHARACTERS Subtitle: PERSONNEL & ENTITY DOSSIERS — FLORA'S WONDERLAND
Cult-voice intro:
There is a theory — and within the Order it is more than theory —
that the Soulbound were not always what they are now.

That before the vessels, there were people.
That those people were not taken.
They were chosen.
Selected by the Ringleader himself — Dr. Joseph M. Cavicus —
for a purpose none of them fully understood
until it was already complete.

They did not die.
They were transformed.
Elevated.
Bound to something permanent in a world where nothing is.

We do not pity them.
We revere them.

THE RINGLEADER — DR. JOSEPH M. CAVICUS
Framing: Not a character card. A separate feature block. Bigger. Sacred.
Header:
DR. JOSEPH M. CAVICUS
THE RINGLEADER

Subtitle: FOUNDER. ARCHITECT. CHOSEN OF HIS OWN DESIGN.
Status: STATUS: ██████████
Dossier:
He built Flora's Wonderland with a vision that no investor,
no city official, no engineer fully understood.

They thought it was an amusement park.

He never corrected them.

Dr. Cavicus disappeared on the night of the Incident.
No body was recovered. No trace was found.
The authorities listed him as a casualty.

The Order of Cavicus does not believe this.

We believe He completed His own work.
That the Ringleader became the most Soulbound of all —
not trapped in a vessel, but woven into the island itself.
Into the frequency. Into the signal.

He is still broadcasting.
You are listening to Him right now.

[ALL FURTHER FILES SEALED — LEVEL 6 CLEARANCE]

CHARACTER 1: FLORA
Name: FLORA — The Flower Mascot Status: STATUS: ACTIVE — SOULBOUND
Dossier:
The first.

Of all the Chosen, Flora was selected earliest —
perhaps before the others knew they had been selected at all.

The Order believes she was willing.
More than willing.

The flowers on the eastern perimeter bloom in November.
In the cold. In the dark.
They have done this every year since 2026.

She presides over the island the way a mother watches a sleeping child —
quietly, completely, without blinking.

Do not seek her out.
She already knows you're looking.

WARNING: Do not make direct eye contact with the vessel.
         She remembers every face.
         Every face.

________________________________________
CHARACTER 2: PYRO
Name: PYRO — The Fire Mascot Status: STATUS: UNKNOWN
Dossier:
Pyro's Choosing was not clean.

Whatever happened in Sector 4 on the night of the Incident —
we have the audio. we have played it once.
we have not played it again.

The suit was recovered. What inhabited it was not.

Our members who have visited Sector 4 report burns on walls
that were not there the week before.
The burns form patterns.
We are still mapping them.

The Order reveres all the Soulbound.
But some of us believe Pyro is something the Ringleader
did not fully intend.
A variable.
An answer to a question He didn't ask.

Approach Sector 4 with the understanding
that reverence may not protect you here.

CHARACTER 3: ??? [CLASSIFIED]

DOSSIER NOTES — BETWEEN THE LINES
Use subtle hints in locked cards for DJ Duo and Trixster without naming them:
For DJ Duo (energetic, cat-faced, music/racing):
[LOCKED — SOLVE SEQUENCE]

Reports from the eastern arcade wing describe something
that moves like it's performing.
Always performing.
Like it never stops.
Like stopping isn't something it understands.

Staff who heard it through the walls said the sound
stayed in their head for days.
Not a bad sound.
That's what made it worse.

For Trixster (large, fast, silent, haunting):
[LOCKED — SOLVE SEQUENCE]

You won't hear it coming.

Three separate witnesses.
Three separate locations.
None of them saw it arrive.
All of them saw it leave.

The security footage from those corridors shows something large.
Fast in a way that doesn't match its size.
It has never made a sound we can verify.

The silence is the part that stays with you.

PAGE HEADER
Title: TAPES Subtitle: MAGNETIC MEDIA REPOSITORY Status: ● REC Alert: ► ANOMALOUS FREQUENCY DETECTED ON TAPE HEADERS → [ANALYZE]
Cult-voice intro:
These recordings did not come from a newsroom.
They did not come from an investigation.

Some were pulled directly from the island by members
who should not have been able to get that close.
Some arrived in the mail with no return address,
postmarked from cities none of us live in.
Some we captured ourselves — tuned to 104.7 MHz,
the frequency the emergency services flagged and abandoned
two weeks after the Incident.

They abandoned it because of what they heard.

We did not abandon it.

The locked recordings require more from you than curiosity.
Complete the sequences.
Earn your access.
What's on them — you'll understand why we protect them
the moment you hear.

TAPE-001 [SEALED]
SOLVE PUZZLE TO UNSEAL THIS TAPE

Recovered from the island in 2027 by two members of the Order
who have since relocated and will not discuss what they found.

The label reads: "OPENING NIGHT — DO NOT PLAY BACK"
We don't know who wrote that.
We don't know if it was a warning or an instruction.

We are still deciding.

VOICE RECORDINGS
Section title: VOICE RECORDINGS Subtitle: RECOVERED AUDIO TRANSMISSIONS
Intro:
Captured on 104.7 MHz between 2026 and 2031.
Some of these voices have been identified.
Most have not.
One of them — we believe — is the Ringleader himself.
We will not tell you which one.
Listen to all of them.
You'll know.

Recording Cards:
1.	WORD DECODER [SOLVE PUZZLE TO UNLOCK] "Captured 03:12 AM — night of the Incident. A voice reading names. Slowly. Deliberately. The names do not appear in any employee roster we have found. We are still searching."

2.	FREQUENCY TUNER [SOLVE PUZZLE TO UNLOCK] "104.7 MHz — partial capture, 2027. This is eleven months after the Incident. The signal had been broadcasting continuously. You will notice it does not sound tired."

3.	WAVEFORM MATCH [SOLVE PUZZLE TO UNLOCK] "Two recordings. 1994 and 2026. Thirty-two years apart. The voice is identical. We have run every analysis we know how to run. Identical."

4.	SIGNAL SCRAMBLE [SOLVE PUZZLE TO UNLOCK] "This came through our equipment during a site visit in 2028. We want to be clear: we did not bring recording equipment to this visit. We do not know how this exists."

5.	WIRE SPLICE [SOLVE PUZZLE TO UNLOCK] "Spliced into the original park telephone system — still active, still connected to something. Recorded by a member who has since left the Order. She said she was done. We understood."

DOCUMENTS
Section title: DOCUMENTS Subtitle: DECLASSIFIED PARK RECORDS & CORRESPONDENCE
Intro:
Physical documents recovered before the government sealed the archive.
Most were marked for destruction.

They weren't destroyed because someone wanted them found.
We believe that someone was the Ringleader.
We believe He has been guiding what we discover
and when we discover it
for a very long time.

Document Cards:
1.	INTERNAL MEMO — 2021 [CLASSIFIED] "Pre-construction. An engineer raised concerns about the subterranean levels. He was reassigned the following day. We have not been able to locate him."

2.	FREQUENCY LOG — 2026 [CLASSIFIED] "Handwritten log from the night of the Incident. The handwriting changes at 02:44 AM. Thirteen minutes before the deviation was officially recorded. We have shown this to three handwriting analysts. None of them will discuss their findings."

3.	EMPLOYEE INCIDENT REPORT [CLASSIFIED] "Filed by a staff member who resigned the morning of October 1st, 2026. Four sentences long. The fourth sentence is not in any language we have identified."

4.	ENGINEERING BLUEPRINT — SUBLEVEL 3 [CLASSIFIED] "This blueprint was not filed with the city. The tunnels it shows do not match the tunnels we have physically walked. There is a room on this map that we have never found."

5.	CORRESPONDENCE — RECIPIENT UNKNOWN [CLASSIFIED] "A letter. No sender. No date. Addressed only to 'The One Who Comes After.' We have debated for two years whether that means us."

6.	FINAL COSTUME INVENTORY — 2026 [CLASSIFIED] "Filed three days before the Incident. One item is listed that corresponds to no known character, no design document, no photograph in the archive. It has a number. It does not have a name."

Intro:
The Order does not have a headquarters.
We do not have a leader — not a living one.
We have this. We have the signal. We have each other.

This is where we share what we've found,
what we believe,
and what we're still trying to understand.

Everything here is a theory until it isn't.
Some of our theories have become confirmed.
That is why we keep going.

VOICE & TONE GUIDE — ORDER OF CAVICUS
The Voice
Small group. True believers. Years of accumulated obsession. They are not performing. They genuinely believe every word. That is what makes it frightening.
Erratic Moments (use sparingly — when it counts)
We were there.
                    We are still there.

Random line breaks. Mid-sentence cuts. Thoughts that trail off. A sentence that stops because whoever was typing had to stop.
Sacred Language — always use these terms
●	The Soulbound — the animatronics
●	The Ringleader — Dr. Joseph M. Cavicus
●	The Chosen — those transformed on the night of the Incident
●	The Incident — what happened in 2026
●	The Binding / The Choosing — the transformation process
●	The Order / The Order of Cavicus — the cult
●	The Signal — the 104.7 MHz broadcast
